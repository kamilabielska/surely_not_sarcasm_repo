### plan
1. **introduction**
    - about sarcasm, sarcasm detection in nlp context
    - literature overview: what has been done a) with the use of machine learning and hand-crafted features, b) with the use of neural networks/deep learning, c) taking context into account
    - structure of the thesis
3. **theory**
    1. neural network
    2. CNN
    3. RNN
        - LSTM
        - GRU
    4. attention?
    5. transformers?
    6. embeddings?
4. **experiments**
    1. data description
    2. text preprocessing
    3. proposed architectures
    4. results + error analysis
5. **conclusions**
